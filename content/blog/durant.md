- **Super Strong for Its Size:** Durant is incredibly strong despite its diminutive stature. It's said to be able to carry over 50 times its own weight! That's like a human carrying a small car!
- **Based on Real-Life Ants:** Durant's design and behavior are inspired by real-life army ants. These ants are known for their incredible teamwork and coordinated attacks, which Durant replicates in battle.
- **Hidden Weaponry:** Durant's large mandibles aren't just for show. They're actually incredibly sharp and can be used to tear through tough objects. Some fans even believe the pincers can detach and become throwing weapons, though this isn't officially confirmed.
- **Fiercely Loyal:** Durant are very social creatures and live in large colonies with a single queen. They are known for their fierce loyalty and will work together to defend their nest from any threat.
