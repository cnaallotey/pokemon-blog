Mimikyu, the Disguise Pokemon, is a fascinating and slightly creepy Ghost/Fairy type introduced in Generation VII. Here's a peek beneath the (literal) mask:

- **A Rejected Look-alike:** Mimikyu's design is based on a Pikachu costume. It desperately wants to be loved like Pikachu, but its true form is said to be so horrifying that anyone who sees it faints.
- **Jealous Heart:** Mimikyu's desire to be loved stems from a deep jealousy of Pikachu's popularity. The yellow electric mouse gets all the attention, while Mimikyu hides in the shadows.
- **The Danger of Disguise:** The ragged Pikachu costume Mimikyu wears is more than just cloth. It's said to be a dangerous curse that can sap the life force of anyone who dares to touch it.
- **Mystery Beneath:** No one has ever seen Mimikyu's true form. The question of what lies under the disguise continues to fuel fan theories and speculation.

Mimikyu may be a bit misunderstood, but its desire for connection is undeniable.  Do you think trainers should befriend Mimikyu or stay away?
